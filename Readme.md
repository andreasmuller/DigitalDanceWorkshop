# Digital Dance Workshop Resonate 2016


Here are the examples I put together for my workshop on Digital Dance at the 2016 Resonate festival, it covers some basic techniques that are useful when dealing with a motion capture driven meshes.


You will need ofxFbx by Nick Hardeman, there is a snapshot of the state of the repo at the time of the workshop here: https://github.com/andreasmuller/ofxFBX/tree/digital_dance_workshop

Github doesn’t like files over 100MB and some of the FBX library files are, so they can’t live in the repo. 
You can download them from here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6jg1j3oxoa05lzb/ofxFbx-fbxsdk_2016.1-libs.zip?dl=0

There are instructions for how to make use of BVH motion capture files with meshes from MakeHuman using Blender here: https://github.com/andreasmuller/DigitalDanceWorkshop/blob/master/MakeHumanBlenderMocapFbx/MakeHumanBlenderMocapFbx.md
